# Configuration file for M-Audio Delta 1010LT PCI card

version = "2.1";

/*
The M-Audio Delta 1010LT PCI card is an 8-input card that shows up as a single device with a single input channel.
In order to have each of the channels available for use in ODAS, you can create a virtual device with each of the
Delta 1010LT mono inputs as a separate channel, and then use that virtual device for input.  This can be done by
putting a configuration such as the following in your ~/.asoundrc or /etc/asound.conf file:

********************************************************************************************
# .asoundrc for a Delta 1010LT to have individual record channels
#
# Create virtual devices
# JACK will need MMAP_COMPLEX support to use this. 
# ICE1712 chip has 12 capture channels and 10 playback channels.
# No. of channels in slaves must equal 12 for capture and 10 for playback
# otherwise "invalid argument" errors result.

pcm.multi_capture {
	type multi
	slaves.a.pcm hw:0 
	slaves.a.channels 12

# First 8 channels of first soundcard (capture)
 	bindings.0.slave a
 	bindings.0.channel 0
 	bindings.1.slave a
 	bindings.1.channel 1
 	bindings.2.slave a
 	bindings.2.channel 2
 	bindings.3.slave a
 	bindings.3.channel 3
 	bindings.4.slave a
 	bindings.4.channel 4
 	bindings.5.slave a
 	bindings.5.channel 5
 	bindings.6.slave a
 	bindings.6.channel 6
 	bindings.7.slave a
 	bindings.7.channel 7
    
}

ctl.multi_capture {
	type hw
	card 0
}
********************************************************************************************

This configuration presumes that your card is showing up as hardware device 0.  If it is not you will need to adjust the
"hw:0" and "card 0" configuration.  Once that configuration is in place, you should be able to use the settings below for 
ODAS.
